## 🔧 Supabase Configuration Updates

### Authentication Settings:
- ✅ Auto-confirm email: **ENABLED** (for development)
- ✅ Signup disabled: **ENABLED** (private application)
- ✅ Anonymous users: **DISABLED** (security)

## ⚠️ Remaining Manual Configuration

### Auth OTP Expiry (Requires Dashboard Action):
The security linter detected that OTP expiry exceeds recommended thresholds. To fix this:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uwwxkkkzkwiftbekezvl/auth/providers)
2. Reduce OTP expiry time to 600 seconds (10 minutes) or less
3. This setting is not available through migrations and must be configured manually

## 🛡️ Security Features Now Active
